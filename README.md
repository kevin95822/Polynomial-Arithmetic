# Polynomial Arithmetic
Polynomial addtion, subtraction, and multiplication
The class is using a map as a container to store the polynomials
For example:
-1+5x+20x^3-9x^2-2x+x^2-2x^3+x^9
will be stored in the map as:
-1 0 5 1 20 3 -9 2 -2 1 1 2 -2 3 1 9
Where the odd index of the number represents the exponent and the even index of the number represents the coefficient.
